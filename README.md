To start create a new terminal and run python gameFile.py 

There are 6 commands that can be ran:
look: Looks around your surroundings and prints out what it sees.
move: Sends a move action which than requests a direction (North, East, South, West) After sending the direction it attempts to move in that direction
use: Asks the user which item they would wish to use (some may be bad, some may be good)
inventory: Lists what items are in the users inventory
exit: Exists the game.

The objective of this game is to make it to the end without dying and trying to get the rarest items :)
